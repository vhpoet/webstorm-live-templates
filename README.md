WebStorm live templates

## Usage
WebStorm has a shitty live template management system. Exporting settings and then importing them doesn't import live templates for some reason. I had my webstorm crash a couple of times and as a result I lost all of my live templates. 

I tried the settings repository too, but I had the same problem, I lose all of the live templates after the crash.

The only way I found to be working is [just copy pasting a raw XML](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/15.0/sharing-live-templates.html). You can copy these templates and paste them right in the Live Templates screen under a custom folder.
